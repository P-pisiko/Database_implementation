# Database-Design-and-Implementation
- The database component of a fitness center is designed and implemented as part of a cooperative effort. 
- We created the EER model and the relational model (3NF) for the database system based on the six provided mobile frameworks.
- We then began creating SQL and noSQL queries to build the databases and add data to them.
- Finally,Â using the six provided wireframes as a guide, we created necessary queries to retrieve data.
